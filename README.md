Repository designed for the Reign of the Masters MM8BDM project.

Project is organized as a pk3 structured into a folder directory, RotM-pk3

Use the cmdhere.bat to open a command prompt for usage of the dam.jar.

Commands are:
dam start - begins compiling and updating a pk3 as you make changes to the directory
dam build - runs a single compile of a pk3 of the current directory
dam acc - compiles the acs exclusively once

For the case of Mac users or needing to exclude ACS files from compilation, see the archive.properties file for settings.

archive.properties is not tracked by GitHub, ensure that every user working on the project is aware of changes being made
so they can properly update their side of it.
